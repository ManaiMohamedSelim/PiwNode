The "AR" project is a design of  an Intelligent Tutoring System piloted  by a robot ,
it was developed to simplify the work for our client "ALEER Esprit".
To illustrate our work we used different tools which are  react js for the front end  ,node js with  express for the backend  and mongodb as 
data base.
Our product contains several features:
 -A facial recognition to login 
 -forum  
 -chatbot for the use of the appliction
 -chat between the tutor and his students
 -contains  training sessions 
 -there will also be emails and sms sent to the user as notifications 2 hours before the course starts.
 -streaming
 
 ### Global architecture
 Our application is devided into two parts:
Server side : built with nodeJS and expressJS created with express generator with some modifications.
Client side: built with RactJs into the Server Side.
